# V5 Vanilla eShop

This was purely an experiment in learning JavaScript. In this repository you will find the main functions and practices used to create modern websites, but in a very rudimentary and educational way. Even though all of the files in here are set up in a way that resembles some JS frameworks, make no mistake, as there is NO framework involved in here. You will also find a JavaScript component (Carousel) and a very functional router made from scratch. This project is hosted on [Netlify](https://v5-vanilla-eshop.netlify.app/).

## Installation

Since this is a vanilla JS project that makes use of no framework, you can just clone this repo and open the index.html located inside the /src folder. From there, the html should be able to run all the necessary scripts to load the website :)
